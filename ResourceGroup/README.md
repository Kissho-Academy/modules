# Azure Resource Group Terraform Module

## Overview & Architecture Summary
This module provisions an Azure Resource Group with optional management lock and custom tags. It is designed for use in enterprise-scale environments, supporting governance, security, and maintainability.

**Architecture:**
- Creates a resource group with a custom name, location, and tags.
- Optionally applies a `CanNotDelete` management lock for protection.
- Tags include a creation timestamp for auditability.

---

## Usage Example
```hcl
module "resourcegroup" {
  source      = "./modules/resourcegroup"
  name        = "rg-app-prod-westeurope"
  location    = "westeurope"
  tags = {
    environment = "prod"
    owner       = "team"
  }
  enable_lock = true
}
```

| location     | string       | yes      | Azure region for the resource group |
| tags         | map(string)  | no       | Tags to assign to the resource group |
| enable_lock  | bool         | no       | Enable a CanNotDelete lock on the resource group |

## Module Features & Optional Blocks
- **Management Lock:** Optional, enabled via `enable_lock` variable.
- **Tags:** Custom tags supported, merged with a creation timestamp.

---

## Security/Compliance Considerations
- **Management Lock:** Prevents accidental deletion of resource group and its resources.
- **Naming:** Enforced length and character validation for resource group name.
- **Tags:** Use tags for cost, ownership, and compliance tracking.

---

## Diagnostics/Monitoring Guidance
- Resource group diagnostics should be enabled via Azure Policy or parent resources.
- Use tags for audit and monitoring integration.

---

## Cost & SKU Notes
- Resource groups themselves are free; costs arise from resources within them.
- Management lock does not incur extra cost.

---

## FAQ / Gotchas
- **Lock:** Only applies a `CanNotDelete` lock if `enable_lock` is true.
- **Tags:** All tags are merged with a creation timestamp.
- **Name Validation:** Resource group name must be <= 90 characters.
